# StatLearningBigData_Project3

This project focuses on shifting focus to prediction and asks students to apply at least one of two types of models: support vector machines (SVM) or tree-based methods. Further, since this is the first of two prediction projects, this project asks students to motivate their prediction question(s) of interest.  The data set I chose for this class was the Hotel Booking Data Set published by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida and Luis Nunes. This data set features booking information for 119k hotel reservations. The data was gathered directly from hotel property management system databases using SQL Server Studio Manager, and contains 32 attributes. 

# Report Details
The assignment requested the  following information:

Introduction:  
Remind me briefly about your data  
Motivate the prediction question(s) you will be focused on answering through your analysis. In particular, include why these questions are useful to answer and any potential considerations you should bear in mind when using these models (are there any concerns about building a prediction model for this outcome?).   
Talk about the underlying assumptions of building a model based on your data. What population does your data represent? How generalizable is your model?  

Modeling:  
What method(s) are you choosing to build a prediction model and why?   
If you are considering multiple approaches, how will you compare them? If you need to choose parameters for your model, how will you choose them?  
What do you notice about the results? Comment on anything that matches what you expected given your work in the previous two projects and anything surprising.   
What can you interpret about the fitted model?  
Are there any new questions that were raised by the results?  
Be sure to include appropriate figures, tables, or summaries.  

Evaluation: 
How “good” of a model were you able to produce?  
Would you recommend using this model to predict your outcome?  
Interpret any evaluation metrics used and put these numbers in the context of your data.   
If your model performs very well, why do you think this is? Do you think this model is a particularly good fit over other potential methods? If your model does not perform very well, are there any clues as to why this is?  

Conclusion  
Summarize what you learned about your data through this project.  
How might your results affect your approach when considering other prediction methods?
